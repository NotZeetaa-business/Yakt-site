# ⚙️ Welcome to Yakt

**Yakt** (Yet Another Kernel Tweaker) is a lightweight, powerful kernel tweaker for Android. It gives you control over performance, battery, and device internals — **root access required**.

## 🔒 Root Required

Yakt needs **root permissions** to access and modify kernel-level settings.

Rooting gives apps privileged control over your Android device. This allows deep system customization — but should be done carefully.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Performance profiles: Battery, Balanced, Gaming, Low Latency
- Real-time hardware info: RAM, GPU, Battery, Kernel, etc.
- DNS changer
- Custom script execution on boot
